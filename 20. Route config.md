##Preface

The routing segment configuration options have been mentioned multiple times in previous articles, which can configure the behavior of pages, layouts, and routing handlers. In this article, we will provide a detailed introduction to the configuration content.

## 1. Segment

If you go through the official documentation of Next.js (in English), you will often find the word Segment, which means:

For simplicity, I translated it as' paragraph '. When placing a segment in the URL scenario:

\*_URL Segment _ _ refers to a portion of the URL Path separated by slashes _ _ URL Path _ \* refers to the URL portion after the domain name (URL Path is composed of URL Segments)

Use this image to illustrate more clearly:

When placing a segment in the Route scenario:

\*_Router Segment _ \*, I translate it as "route segment", where each folder in the route represents a route segment. Each routing segment is mapped to a corresponding URL segment:

In this image, '/dashboard/settings' consists of three segments:

*`/`: Root Segment
*Dashboard: Segment
\*Settings: Leaf Segment

PS: Leaf segment refers to a segment without child nodes
