##Preface

At the beginning of this article, we will enter the components section and provide a detailed introduction to the four built-in components of NextJS, namely: '<Image>', 'Font', '<Link>', and '<Script>'. They are all specially abstracted components optimized by NextJS based on native HTML tags, and should be used as much as possible during development.

The<Image>component implements lazy loading and automatically adjusts image size based on device size, the<Link><span></span>component implements background pre fetch of resources, making page transitions faster and smoother, and the<Script>component allows you to control loading and executing third-party scripts, etc. We will provide detailed information on the specific functions and APIs in the components section.

This article will introduce the<Image>component, as images often occupy a large part of the webpage size, and image optimization is of utmost importance` The Image component also provides a lot of props and configuration items. Understanding these props and their underlying principles helps us to use the Image component more deeply and bring a better user experience.
