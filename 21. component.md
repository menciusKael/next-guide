##Preface

At the beginning of this article, we will enter the components section and provide a detailed introduction to the four built-in components of NextJS, namely: '<Image>', 'Font', '<Link>', and '<Script>'. They are all specially abstracted components optimized by NextJS based on native HTML tags, and should be used as much as possible during development.

The<Image>component implements lazy loading and automatically adjusts image size based on device size, the<Link><span></span>component implements background pre fetch of resources, making page transitions faster and smoother, and the<Script>component allows you to control loading and executing third-party scripts, etc. We will provide detailed information on the specific functions and APIs in the components section.

This article will introduce the<Image>component, as images often occupy a large part of the webpage size, and image optimization is of utmost importance` The Image component also provides a lot of props and configuration items. Understanding these props and their underlying principles helps us to use the Image component more deeply and bring a better user experience.

## Images and LCP

### 1. Image proportion

according to [Web Almanac](https://link.juejin.cn/?target=https%3A%2F%2Falmanac.httparchive.org%2Fen%2F2022%2Fmedia "https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/media") In the introduction, image size accounts for a large part of the typical website page size. According to statistics, the median total size of websites in June 2021 was 2019 KB (mobile), of which 881 KB were images. This is more than the sum of HTML (30 KB), CSS (72 KB), JavaScript (461 KB), and fonts (97 KB).

On the vast majority of pages (70% mobile devices, 80% desktop), the most influential are images. Largest Contentful Paint（Maximum content drawing, abbreviated as：[LCP](https://link.juejin.cn/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Farticles%2Flcp%3Fhl%3Dzh-cn "https://web.dev/articles/lcp?hl=zh-cn")） It is a web performance metric that identifies the largest content element in the first screen. Most of the time, this element has an image.

### 2. LCP background

Considering that LCP is not a commonly known concept, we will introduce LCP separately.

For web developers, measuring the loading speed of the main content on a webpage has always been a challenge.

Traditionally, we use methods such as load and DOMContentLoaded, but they do not represent the time the user sees content on the screen.

And for first content rendering (FCP), if the page has a loading effect, the time obtained is also inaccurate.

Of course, there are also indicators such as First Effective Mapping (FMP), but these indicators are very complex and often incorrect. So it cannot be used to determine the loading time of the main content.

According to discussions in the W3C Web Performance Working Group and research by Google, a more accurate way to measure the loading time of the main content of a webpage is to look at the rendering time of the largest element. This is LCP.

### 3. LCP Concepts and Standards

The Large Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the rendering time of the largest image or text block visible in the viewport (relative to the time the webpage first starts loading).

In order to provide a good user experience, the website should strive to set the Large Contentful Paint to \* _ 2.5 seconds _ \* or shorter.

Let's take a look at some examples of LCP:

![](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/d45d5ac94a014e66a4b791e61e2a41dc~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-jj-mark:3024:0:0:0:q75.awebp#?w=1600&h=621&s=397379&e=png&b=fbfbfb)

So the question is, pages are often loaded in stages, and the largest element in a webpage may be constantly changing. How is LCP calculated?

Firstly, the browser will limit the elements of LCP to specific element types, such as<img>elements, block level elements that contain text nodes or other embedded text elements, the first frame drawn for autoplay of<video>elements, the first frame of animated image formats (such as GIF animations), and so on (this is to simplify the issue, as calculating the size of all elements would be too complex and unnecessary).

Then, after drawing the first frame, the browser will immediately assign a Performance Entry of the large content point type to identify the largest content element. After rendering subsequent frames, as long as the maximum content element changes, the API will assign another Performance Entry. Simply put, when drawing each frame, the browser will indicate the maximum content element.

When the user interacts with the page (by clicking, scrolling, or pressing a button), the browser stops reporting new entries. (Because user interaction often changes the content displayed to the user, such as scrolling operations). Generally speaking, the startTime value of the last entry issued is the LCP value.

## `<Image>`

### 1. Functional characteristics

Explaining LCP is just to help everyone realize the importance of image optimization (after all, the biggest content element is often the image). Returning to the `<Image>` component, NextJS implements these optimization features based on native HTML `<img>` elements:

1. Size optimization: Automatically provide images of the correct size for each device, and also use modern image formats such as WebP and AVIF.
2. Visual stability: prevent layout shift during image loading (Layout Shift)
3. Faster page loading: Images only load when entering the viewport, using lazy loading function and optional use of blurry placeholders
4. Flexible configuration: Adjust images as needed, and images on remote servers can also be adjusted accordingly

We will cover these functions one by one when explaining the component API.

### 2. Basic usage

This is an example of using the<Image>component, which looks like using a normal img element:

<pre><div class="code-block-extension-header"><div class="code-block-extension-headerLeft"><div class="code-block-extension-foldBtn"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.924 9.617A1 1 0 0 0 16 9H8a1 1 0 0 0-.707 1.707l4 4a1 1 0 0 0 1.414 0l4-4a1 1 0 0 0 .217-1.09z" data-name="Down"></path></svg></div><span class="code-block-extension-lang">javascript</span></div><div class="code-block-extension-headerRight"><div class="code-block-extension-copyCodeBtn">复制代码</div></div></div><code class="hljs language-javascript code-block-extension-codeShowNum"><span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="1">// app/page.js</span>

<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="4">export default function Page() {</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="5">  return (</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="6">    <span class="xml">&lt;Image</span></span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="7">      src=&#34;/profile.png&#34;</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="8">      width={500}</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="9">      height={500}</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="10">      alt=&#34;Picture of the author&#34;</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="11">    /&gt;</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="12">  )</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="13">}</span>
</code></pre>

### 3. Supported props

`<Image>` The component supports passing in these props:
