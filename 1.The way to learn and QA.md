## common problem

##### Q: Does learning Next.js require a basic knowledge of React?

A: A little bit, but not much. If you have used React to do projects, or have read documents or written demos, that is enough. If you encounter problems with React and don't know how to do it, just check it again.

#####  Q: Does learning Next.js require Node.js basics?

A: A little bit, but not much, less than React. If you set yourself a seemingly "perfect" learning route of first learning React systematically, then learning Node, and finally learning Next.js, I suggest you give up as soon as possible.

Learning must not pay attention to "delayed gratification". The whole process takes too long, and if you don’t see any feedback in the middle, you can easily give up. Even if a small goal is achieved in the process, although you feel your own excellence and growth, this feedback is often relatively mild. If something takes a long time and no big results can be seen, due to the human nature of seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages, people will naturally choose to avoid and give up.

Precisely because learning itself requires overcoming pain, learning must pay more attention to "timely feedback and timely satisfaction." To put it simply, don’t worry about it, it’s not that difficult. Just go to Next.js and start the project after learning the basic knowledge. The process is painful but efficient. Doing projects and solving actual problems is the most real, effective and direct feedback.

#### Q: Next.js, Nuxt.js, Nest.js can’t be distinguished clearly

A: To put it simply, Next is the React full-stack framework, Nuxt is the Vue full-stack framework, and Nest is the back-end framework. In other words, Next.js is suitable for full-stack projects. In Next.js, you can write both pages and interfaces, and you can do it all in one project.

Moreover, Next.js has various built-in APIs and tools that facilitate development, so if you want to quickly create a full-stack project with good performance, use Next.js.

Nuxt.js and Next.js can be discussed together, but there is actually no need to discuss them together. This is more a matter of technical selection. If you know React, use Next.js, and if you know Vue, use Nuxt.js. Nest.js is a pure back-end framework, which is used to write purely back-end services. To put it simply, use Next and Nuxt to write full-stack projects, and use Nest to write purely back-end services. The three solve different scene problems, you can choose according to your own needs.

##### Q: Is there a future for learning Next.js?

A: Currently, the average weekly download volume of Next.js Npm is about 634W, which is the mainstream technology selection abroad. The first production framework for React is also Next.js.

Moreover, Next.js relies on Vercel and has hired many industry leaders, such as Sebastian Markbage (former Tech Lead of the React team), Rich Harries (Svelte author), Donny (SWC author), Tobias Koppers (Webpack author), Jared Palme ( Turborepo founder) and so on, the all-star development team has a promising future.

PS: As for people’s future, they must ultimately be created by themselves…

##### Q: Any other suggestions?

A: The Feynman Learning Method is a very well-known and highly respected learning method. The core of it is - when you are ready to learn a new knowledge, you must stand in the position of a teacher and assume that you want to explain this knowledge to others. Then you must express it in the most concise, clear and easy-to-understand language so that people outside the industry can understand it.

To put it simply, it is to determine the goals to be learned, carry out topic learning, and then use teaching as learning, and constantly re-learn, review and reflect during the output process.

Output is actually a higher requirement for learners. Because when outputting knowledge, you cannot simply copy and paste. Instead, you can not only summarize the essence of the knowledge, but also add your own deep understanding, and spread it out in a language that everyone can understand and understand.
