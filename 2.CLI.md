### Preface

---

Welcome to Next.js! Before learning specific knowledge points, let's first create a Next.js project. Only by creating a runnable project can you debug and understand while learning, thereby achieving twice the result with half the effort.

Fortunately, Next.js provides the out-of-the-box create-next-app scaffolding, which has built-in support for TypeScript, ESLint and other functions, and can realize automatic compilation and packaging with zero configuration.

In this article, we will explain two ways to create projects: automatic project creation and manual project creation, as well as script commands commonly used when developing projects. At the same time, we will provide a detailed explanation of the next command behind the script to help you understand the functions and optional parameters implemented by each command.

### 1. Automatically create projects

#### 1.1. Environmental requirements

This booklet is based on the latest version v14, which requires Node.js 18.17 and later, and supports macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.

#### 1.2. Create project

The fastest way to create a Next.js project is to use the create-next-app scaffolding. You just need to run:

`npx create-next-app@latest`

Next, there will be a series of operation prompts, such as setting the project name, whether to use TypeScript, whether to enable ESLint, whether to use Tailwind CSS, etc. You can choose according to your actual situation. If you don’t know how to choose at the beginning, just follow the default choices. We will gradually understand the functions of these choices as we study the booklet.

Note: In order to reduce the amount of code displayed, the sample code in this booklet does not use TypeScript.

After completing the selection, create-next-app will automatically create project files and install dependencies. The created and installed project directories and files are as follows:

If you don’t use **npx**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, and bunx are also supported:

```
yarn create next-app
pnpm create next-app
bunx create-next-app
```
