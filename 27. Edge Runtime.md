## 1. Edge Runtime

### 1.1 Introduction

When learning Next.js, we may come across the concepts of Edge Runtime and Node.js Runtime. In Next.js, you can think of runtime as a set of libraries, APIs, and general functions available during execution. On the server side, there are two runtimes that can be used to render applications:

- Nodejs Runtime，This is the default runtime that can use the Node.js API and its ecosystem packages
- Edge Runtime, based on [Web API](https://link.juejin.cn/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Fdocs%2Fapp%2Fapi-reference%2Fedge "https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge")

In Next.js, Edge Runtime is a subset of the Nodejs API. Although it has limited functions, it is also lighter and faster. It is suitable for developing small and simple functions and implementing dynamic and personalized content with low latency.

Is this just a confusing understanding? To explain the concept of Edge Runtime, let's start with CDN.

CDN, the full name of Content Delivery Network, is a virtual network composed of servers and data centers distributed in different geographical locations. Its purpose is to distribute content to users with minimal latency. Simply put, if you request a website in the United States in Hangzhou, the response will be delayed because of the long physical distance. However, if the content of the website is synchronized to the server in Hangzhou and the content on the server in Hangzhou is requested instead, the response time will be faster. This group of servers in Hangzhou for caching and transmitting network content is called "Edge".

When you are already a mature Edge, you have to learn to execute code. When you can execute code, the CDN network becomes a more powerful Edge Network. The calculations that occur at the Edge are also called edge computing, which can share some of the processing content with the main server. Understanding these concepts also helps to understand the concept of Edge Runtime. The term Edge refers to this environment for instant serverless computing.

You may think of Serverless. Serverless is good, but different instances will be started and the environment will be reinitialized every time a request is made. Although the underlying architecture will be optimized a lot, it still cannot maximize the reuse of resources. For Edge Runtime, you can deploy the Edge Runtime environment through Vercel Edge functions or Cloudflare workers or some other tools. Edge Runtime does not run Nodejs, but uses the V8 engine and Web APIs, which is lighter and starts faster. Multiple requests can use one instance to better reuse resources.

For specific support, see the documentation provided by Next.js. [Edge Runtime Supports](https://link.juejin.cn/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Fdocs%2Fapp%2Fapi-reference%2Fedge "https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge") document。

### 1.2 Enable

You can specify the runtime for individual routes in Next.js. To do this, you need to declare a variable called `runtime` and export it. The variable must be a string with the value `'nodejs'` or `'edge'`. For example:

<pre><div class="code-block-extension-header"><div class="code-block-extension-headerLeft"><div class="code-block-extension-foldBtn"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.924 9.617A1 1 0 0 0 16 9H8a1 1 0 0 0-.707 1.707l4 4a1 1 0 0 0 1.414 0l4-4a1 1 0 0 0 .217-1.09z" data-name="Down"></path></svg></div></div><div class="code-block-extension-headerRight"></div></div><code class="hljs language-javascript code-block-extension-codeShowNum"><span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="1">// app/page.js</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="2">export const runtime = &#39;edge&#39; // &#39;nodejs&#39; (default) | &#39;edge&#39;</span>
</code></pre>

You can also define a runtime on a layout, which will apply the Edge Runtime to all routes under that layout:

<pre><div class="code-block-extension-header"><div class="code-block-extension-headerLeft"><div class="code-block-extension-foldBtn"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.924 9.617A1 1 0 0 0 16 9H8a1 1 0 0 0-.707 1.707l4 4a1 1 0 0 0 1.414 0l4-4a1 1 0 0 0 .217-1.09z" data-name="Down"></path></svg></div></div><div class="code-block-extension-headerRight"></div></div><code class="hljs language-javascript code-block-extension-codeShowNum"><span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="1">// app/layout.js</span>
<span class="code-block-extension-codeLine" data-line-num="2">export const runtime = &#39;edge&#39; // &#39;nodejs&#39; (default) | &#39;edge&#39;</span>
</code></pre>

If you don't specify it, the default is Node.js Runtime, so if you don't plan to change it, there is no need to use this option.
